My name is Yoh, and I'm an experienced Software Engineer who likes to be nerd-sniped on performance and API design topics.

In my spare time I enjoy being with my cat stable 🐈 which surrounds me usually even during work hours, and scale modelling sometimes turning into reverse engineering. Not sure that this part of my live will be shared here, but probably you can catch that in other places like [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@yoh).
